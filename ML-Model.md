Data Cleaning:

Handling Missing Values: Replace, fill, or remove missing data using techniques such as mean/median imputation, interpolation, or using algorithms that can handle missing values.
Removing Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid redundancy.
Handling Outliers: Detect and handle outliers using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR) or domain knowledge.
Data Transformation:

Scaling and Normalization: Standardize features by scaling them to a standard range (e.g., 0-1 or -1 to 1) using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical data into numerical form using methods like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding.
Log Transformation: Apply logarithmic transformations to skewed data to stabilize variance and make the data more Gaussian-like.
Feature Engineering:

Feature Creation: Derive new features from existing ones (e.g., extracting date features such as year, month, day).
Feature Selection: Select relevant features using techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance from models, or dimensionality reduction methods like PCA.
Data Integration:

Merging Data: Combine data from different sources or tables to create a unified dataset.
Handling Time Series Data: Process time series data by creating lag features, rolling statistics, or dealing with seasonality.
Data Reduction:

Sampling: Reduce the size of the dataset by sampling a representative subset.
Dimensionality Reduction: Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to reduce the number of features.
Handling Imbalanced Data:

Resampling Techniques: Use oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling to balance class distributions.
Class Weights: Adjust class weights in algorithms to account for imbalance.
Splitting Data:

Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to assess model robustness and prevent overfitting.
